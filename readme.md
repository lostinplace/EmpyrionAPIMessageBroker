# Empyrion API Message Broker

## FAQ

### Q:  What is this?

The Empyrion mod api is kind of unintuitive and difficult to work with.  In the course of developing a few mods, I developed an understanding of what was available, and how to make it easier to work with.  I developed this library to enable callback-style management of API requests and responses.
